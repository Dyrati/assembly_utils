A Hacker’s Map of Golden Sun 2
by Teawater and Salanewt


With thanks to Atrius for some information that went into the making of this guide.


Introduction


Thank you for taking the time to look at this guide. Currently, most of the contents in here are meant to list functions and data banks in general, but many areas of this document might describe them in more detail. Please excuse the mess. Also, if you’re using Firefox to view this document, consider using Chrome. Or nevermind? This thing can take far too long to load at times! So I will probably make a .txt version. (While this one still remains the most up-to-date?)


May 30, 2020 = If you are viewing this guide, please be careful about editing. Version History is slow to use. (I assume it tries to load all versions?) So if I have any major issues with that, I will not use it, and may begin making manual backups. (Considering monthly ones.)


“-->” is intended to represent a link when converted to an HTML document, but this is WIP.


Have a nice day!

For this value the settings indicated give each attack the listed chance of being used
0 - All attacks have an equal 1/8 chance of being used.


1 = Linear climb
Notice the first four abilities have an increased chance, and the last four have a decreased chance.
They all are a difference of 6 (Which I assume is suppose to represent +/- 20%, but ends up being +/- 18.75%)
Except it does look like it could be caps at +2/3rds and x1/3rd.
Attack 0=53/256 (x1.65625 ; reaching for x1.7?)

3 and 4 execute their moves in numerical order. One starts with the first move, while the others starts with a random move.
5 always selects the first ability.
6 always defends.

0811C594 = proto_execute_action (r0: battle_RAM/02030338)
Note: Function call still exists in used code at #08119C52, but can only be accessed by setting flag x16A (a buggy flag that is used for two things and causes game freezing)


1. If leftmost slot (i.e. acting unit) is downed, end function and return -1


2.
* Call #0811CD30 with battle_RAM address; this is meant to grab a random living character from the currently acting character’s side, but fails to (see description for that function).
* The value that would be loaded is stored to battle_RAM + 0x0A (battle slot value), and then the unit ID is loaded and used to manually assign a camera rotation
   * 0x00002000 if unit ID < 4, otherwise 0xFFFFC000 if unit ID > 4; in either case, set x3C as the timer
The implication with these value reads (and the code’s failure to properly check if the currently acting unit is downed or not) is that the unit ID and battle slot values stored within battle RAM were swapped at some point in development. Battle slot ID would have been at battle_RAM +0x00, and unit ID would have been at +0x0A.


3.
* Call #0803CCA8 = Clear text var list
* Check action type values:
      * Note: Attack = 0 and Item = 2 is assumed based on prior knowledge; the others match up with actual action types used in the final game so 0 and 2 are likely correct as well, but they call the same shared function so it is hard to say
   * 0 = Attack
      * Set camera position to “mid-round”

   * 1 = Psynergy

* Otherwise, if Flee fails, then display string 3225 0 “But they can’t get away!”; return 0
0811C6C4 = End




0811C6CC = proto_defend
1. Check if the acting unit’s ID is valid (call to #0811C650 = proto_is_unit_valid_test)
* Return -1 if the acting unit’s ID is not valid
2. Check if acting unit is downed (HP = 0)
* Return 0 if the acting unit is downed
3. Print string 3116 = “[18][1] is defending!”

0811C984 = proto_attack_test(???_address)
This determines if both the Attacker and their Target actually exists, then makes the Attacker attack their target (likely with a standard attack) and animates them. Some other stuff kinda happens, but only as it relates to the carrying out of the attack action.
0.
???_address moved to r6                - Unknown address, but it held/holds various arguments and may still exist elsewhere
A value is loaded from an address that is loaded from #030000B0: Camera Destination Data (#02031090) in the final game
 - If camera_angle = 2000:
   - Then delay for 10 (x0A) frames
   - Else delay for 30 (x1E) frames
1. 
MOV r5, sp
Load attacker_ID from ???_address + 0 and store to sp x08
Call #0811C650 = proto_is_unit_valid_test (charslot_ID; 0-7 or 80-85)
 - If unit is valid:
   - Load target_ID from ???_address + 10 (x0A), store it to sp x24, then make it signed
     - Signing appears to negate enemy IDs? NOT CERTAIN (someone else can check)
     - If invalid, return -1 and end function
 - If unit is invalid, return -1 and end function
2. 
Load attacker_ID's character RAM address, and then... do nothing with it
It gets overwritten immediately by target_ID's character RAM address, which... also does nothing with it
This gets overwritten by a random 16-bit number (08014878 = rand() as Int16), which ALSO does nothing with it
 - I suspect that, if these functions did not do something else at one point in time, that some code may have been commented out prior to compilation
3. 
Load Target (Number Var 1) text argument, then print text string {3168} - "[18][1] attacks!"
Call #0811C120 = attack_anim with the following arguments: (attacker_ID, target_ID, 0x0D (13), 0)
 - This function is called directly twice by the main, final function that differentiates between attack types, as well as indirectly via 
   function table call by several battle animations
Load Attacker's Sprite/Actor RAM Address
 - Set anim_speed to x10 (16)
Load Target's Sprite/Actor RAM Address... but does nothing with it; more commented out code?
4. 
Store a value of 1 to to sp x14 and, if the Target is a PC, to sp x04 as well
 - If the Target is not a PC then a value of 0 is stored to sp x04 instead
Store a value of 4 to sp x1C, then delay for 4 frames
 - Call #08138008 (#0815E320 = Physical attack animations), with the SP loaded from r5 to use as a function variable
Return Target, then Attacker positions to defaults




0811CA54 = proto_action
General note: Like with proto_execute_action, the acting unit’s value is treated as a battle/party slot value rather than an ID, and the inverse is also true of the target value (being treated as an ID instead of a slot #).
1. This starts similarly to proto_execute_action, loading the acting unit’s ID and treating it as if it is the unit’s slot value instead.
* 0x00002000 if unit ID < 4, otherwise 0xFFFFE000 if unit ID > 4; in either case, set x28 as the timer


2. * r6 = sp +x08:
* Copy action type argument (e.g. ability ID, item slot value) from battle RAM to r6 + 0x00 (sp x08)
* Copy action range from battle RAM to r6 + 0x10 (sp x18)
* Copy user ID (originally user battle slot value) from battle RAM to r6 + 0x08 (sp x10)
* Copy target battle slot value (originally target ID) from battle RAM to r6 +0x0C (sp x14)
* Call #0811C650 = proto_is_unit_valid_test (charslot_ID; 0-7 or 80-85)
* Return -1 if the target is not valid/does not exist


3.  
* Call #0811A188: List all units for the corresponding side of battle, depending on target ID (PC or enemy)
* Use sp x2C as reserved space for the list (r1 argument; list saved in r7)
* Store number of units to r6 + 0x14 (sp x1C), for some reason; this gets replaced before it can be used
* Load byte from #0203008D, used to temporarily negate flag 1 (display PP) in function call to #0804297C when the action is being performed
4.  
* Load user’s sprite data via Call to #0811BE3C = load_char_sprite_header_address(char slot)
* Set user’s animation to 3 and animation speed to 0x10
* Check target ID:
* If target = PC:
* Store 1 to r6 + 0x04 (sp x0C)
* If target = enemy:
* Store 0 to r6 + 0x04 (sp x0C)
* In either case, store 1 to r6 + 0x14 (sp x1C) and call #0811A188 again, depending on which side is being targeted
* r7 = 0, copy r6 to r2, and enter into a loop if the value at sp x1C != 0... which is guaranteed


5.  Loop, which works in the following process for each character ID in list:
1. * OBJ_pointer from load_char_sprite_header_address(char slot) (e.g. #020300D0 + 0x00)
* From OBJ_pointer, load sprite_dynamics (e.g. 0203136C)
* From sprite_dynamics, load # of sprite layers (+ 0x1B)
* If it has exactly one layer (i.e. base sprite with no shadow, weapon, or indicator sprite), then skip to c)
2.  
* # of extra sprite layers stored to r12
* [Will double check this later but there’s an internal loop for every sprite layer]
3. * Increment and check loop counter, r7, against number of units... which is replaced with 1 earlier, meaning it doesn’t loop for every unit and it only picks the earliest one in the list
* Start back from a) until every unit ID has been checked
6. 
* Play each ePower boost animation in succession, from Venus through to Jupiter
* Execute ability animation
* Set user’s animation to 1
7. 
* Return unit list units to original positions (unless there are none), then return user to original position




0811CBE8 = proto_deal_damage_test(charslot_ID, damage, crit_landed_flag, ?)? Has a setAnimation(,5) (Is hit animation), and a setAnimation(,1) (Is idling animation) - Unused
This seems to be a remnant of earlier code that, if it exists, appears to no longer call this function. It is unknown how critical hit damage was previously calculated, but the order of things reflects how damage is executed in prerelease footage. See this video for an exact timestamp; the ability animation happens, then the targets are shown getting hit consecutively, not simultaneously like they do in the final game. The damage text also matches.
0.

 - Load Damage (Number Var 5) and Target (Number Var 1) text arguments
 - Print corresponding damage string depending on ID check: Unused; the game uses other "x takes y damage" strings in the final code
 - For enemy targets only, load Target (Number Var 1) text argument again

Event Initialization:
080CCDC0 =(Function for doing event?)
080CE370 =(Function for finding a match?)


Events are listed in this order:
Doors (Sorted by Door Numbers)
Events on collision
(Type 8)
Psynergy
(Type 9)


Event Data:


Event Type (4-bit?)
0 = NPC
1 = Door
2 = Scripted event on collision
3 = Scripted event on command (A button)
4 = Used Item
5 = Used Psynergy (9085=Reveal; 8C15=Move; 8D15=Mind Read); ability seems to be left byte, based on matching ID
6 = ? (See Map 71 Yampi Desert for research.)
7 = (NPC-related?)
8 = Pushing Objects
9 = Pushing Objects


Event Type Arg (4-bit?)
For doors = Door type (Upstairs/downstairs/no stairs/etc.)


If type 0: 02 = True if holding button during collision. (Not moving.)
If type 1: 02=Up stairs 03=Down stairs
If type 3: Dialogue for checking something. (This is what’s being checked. Ex: Chest, jar, barrel, etc.)
If type 5: Ability/Psynergy
??? (0?)
Event Identifier # (NPC objects or Map objects depending on type.)
Flag
Execute (Door numbers/Text entry/Pointer if scripted/etc.)

[a]Allocates a global object on the heap, prioritising IWRAM over EWRAM.  A pointer to the allocated object is stored in 03000000+rel_addr, and also returned.


I assume 08014D00 works the same way too


Valid input values for rel_addr are probably any multiple of 4 between 8 and 0xFC (below 8 would trash pointers to free memory; above 0xFC would trash the interrupt handler)
